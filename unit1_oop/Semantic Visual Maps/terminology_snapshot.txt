# TERMINOLOGY SNAPSHOT

- base class / parent class: the immediate class you inherit from (e.g., Animal is Dog’s base).
- superclass: any ancestor up the chain (could include multiple in multiple inheritance).
- subclass / child class: the deriving class (e.g., Dog).
- metaclass: the “class of a class” (usually `type`); controls how classes are created.
