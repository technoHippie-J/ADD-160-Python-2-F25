Lesson: Creating a Custom Address Book Class in Python

Objective: By the end of this lesson, students will be able to write a custom class for an address book that includes getter and setter methods for various attributes, utilizes at least three magic methods, and includes docstrings for documentation.

    - Create a class named AddressBook with the following attributes:

-first_name
-last_name
-birthday
-email
-street_address
-city
-state
-zip
-phone

    - Include getter and setter methods for each attribute.

2. Implement Magic Methods
    - Implement at least three magic methods. Some possibilities include:

__str__ - to nicely print the information about each person.
__repr__ - to provide an official string representation of the object.
__eq__ - to compare two AddressBook objects for equality.

3. Write Docstrings
    - Include docstrings for your class and its methods to provide documentation. Use the following template:

'''

Attributes:
   include attribute details here

Methods:
   include method details here

4. Create Instances and Print Information
